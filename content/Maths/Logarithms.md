Roots and indices are the same thing, and here we will see that logarithms are also indices.

## Definition

Let $a$ and $x$ be real numbers, with $a > 1$ and $x > 0$. Then the _logarithm_ of $x$ to the base $a$, denoted $\log _a x$, is the number $y$ such that $x = a^y$.

The logarithm is the power $a$ has to be risen to in order to obtain $x$.

Remember, $x$ has to be a positive number. The log of zero or a negative number isn't defined.

## Examples

- $\log_2 8$
Since $2^3 = 8$, that means $\log_2 8=3$. 
- $\log_33$
Since $3^1$ = 3, $\log_33$ must be $1$.

## Breakdown

It's pretty simple when you break it down, so let's try a very simple one below.

- $\log_216$

What do we need to raise 2 to the power of, to get 16?

- $2^4$ = 16

We raise it to the power of 4, which means $\log_216$ = $4$.

Simple, right?
Let's try a scarier looking one.

## The Scarier One

- $\log_5(\dfrac{1}{25})$

It's not that bad I promise! We just need to do the same thing we did last time.
What do we need to raise 5 to the power of to get $\dfrac{1}{25}$?

- $5^{-2}$ = 0.04 or $\dfrac{1}{25}$

So now we know $\log_5 \dfrac{1}{25} = -2$.

Easy, right?

Q2)

> [!question]- $\log_8 \dfrac{1}{2}$
> $\log_8 \dfrac{1}{2} = \dfrac{1}{-3}$, since $\dfrac{1}{2} = 8^{- \dfrac{1}{3}}$
