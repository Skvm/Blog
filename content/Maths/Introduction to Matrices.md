## Definition
A $m * n$ $matrix$ is a rectangle of numbers having $m$ rows by $n$ columns, enclosed by brackets. For example:


$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3  \\
4 & 5 & 6\\
\end{pmatrix}
$

is a 2x3 matrix and 

$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2  \\
4 & 5  \\
7 & 8
\end{pmatrix}
$

is a 3x2 matrix.

## Notes

Please note these matrices are _not_ the "same size" - they do have the same amount of values inside, but they must have the same amount of rows and the same amount of columns to be considered the same size.

A matrix that only has one row is (sometimes) called a _row vector_, and a matrix with only one column is called a _column vector_.

Matrices are normally labelled using capital letters like $A,B,C$ etc.

If a matrix has the same number of rows as colums (e.g a 3x3 matrix), it is called a *square matrix.*

Values are denoted like so: $a_{bc}$ 

The number appearing in the $B$th row and the $C$th column is called the ($b$,$c$) entry of $A$.

As an example:
If we take $A$ to be a $2*3$ matrix like so: 
$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3  \\
4 & 5 & 6\\
\end{pmatrix}
$

Then $a_{21}$ = 4, as 4 is in the 2nd column and the 1st row.

And as a final note:
Two matrices are equal *only* if they have the same size **and** the values inside are all equal.
